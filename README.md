# NodeJS Learnyounode Challenges
Started with the [learnyounode](http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers) from NodeSchool.

`npm install -g learnyounode`

`learnyounode`

Solutions are provided in [NodeJSChallengeSolutions](https://github.com/shawnfan/NodeJS/tree/master/NodeJSChallengeSolutions)

Note: In my solution I used 3 node modules which are not provided, so you need to run the following command to install those small modules:

`npm install bl`

`npm install strftime`

`npm through2-map`

Afterwards, simply run 
`learnyounode run [challenge_xx].js` or 
`learnyounode verify [challenge_xx].js` to see results
